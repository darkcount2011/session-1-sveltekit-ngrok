# Setup for the session

each team, have one person fork the project
Then, have the forked project cloned into your local environment, the forked repo is the repo you are gonna work on

After cloning run
```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

go to the localhost:port you created

Then download NGROK:
https://ngrok.com/

and ensure you have that running as well on the same port as your local dev environment is running to forward it.
